> ### Clarke's three laws
> 1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
> 2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
> 3. **Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.**

## Setup

1. Get Bun: https://bun.sh/
2. Clone this mess:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/geoffsee/agent-mst.git
   cd agent-mst
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bun install
   ```
4. Set up your env: (automatically picks this up when using `bun run index.ts`)
   ```
   echo "CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env.local
   ```

## Running

```
bun run src/index.ts
```

It'll spit out some logs. If it doesn't work, check your api key. If it still doesn't work, you probably need more coffee.       
```stdio

## What it does

Creates state machines for various scenarios (customer support, software dev, etc.). Uses Claude to decide state transitions. _But why_...? **yes**.

## Extending

Add your own state machine types in `createStateMachine()`. Follow the existing pattern or something better.

## Structure

- `src/index.ts`: this is what you came for
